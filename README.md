This is a local kibana setup, this consists of an ELK stack 
here, we can add the custom hard coded logs just to check the pattern we can see in kibana.

The images running in this docker-compose yaml file
1. Elastic search
2. logstash
3. kibana

so, here in this Repo, we have config, logs and pipeline in logstash
in the pipeline the kibana log visualization is written in configuration file
